# Feature: Phase 4 Observability & Cost Controls

## User Stories
- As a **platform operator**, I want comprehensive metrics dashboards so that I can monitor OpenAI Whisper usage and costs
- As a **school administrator**, I want budget alerts so that I can control STT spending
- As a **developer**, I want robust error monitoring so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues
- As a **compliance officer**, I want audit logs so that I can verify FERPA compliance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics dashboards operational with key Whisper metrics
- [ ] Budget alerts configured and tested (per-school, daily caps)
- [ ] Staging deployment successful with cost monitoring
- [ ] E2E test suite hardened and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (remove Databricks STT references)

## Technical Specifications

### Backend Changes (Remaining)
- Monitoring dashboards: Wire existing Prometheus metrics to visualization
- Budget API endpoints: `/api/v1/schools/:schoolId/budget/usage`, `/api/v1/schools/:schoolId/budget/alerts`
- Health check enhancements: Add Whisper service status to `/api/v1/ready`
- Configuration tuning: `STT_WINDOW_SECONDS` optimization based on 429 rates

### Frontend Changes
- Teacher dashboard: Budget usage display
- Admin panel: School-level budget configuration
- Error reporting: Enhanced WebSocket error handling

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Budget calculation, metrics collection, circuit breaker behavior
- Integration tests: Multi-group WebSocket flow, budget enforcement
- E2E tests: Classroom-like load testing (25+ groups), cost validation
- Soak tests: Extended sessions to validate memory cleanup and window tuning

## Architecture Compliance
- [ ] Follows feature-sliced design
- [ ] No cross-feature imports
- [ ] Unidirectional data flow
- [ ] FERPA/COPPA compliant
- [ ] Performance considerations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All requirements implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] E2E tests added (if applicable)
