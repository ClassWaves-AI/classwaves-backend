export default function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION || '1.0.0',
    services: {
      websocket: 'healthy', // Check WS connection
      audio: 'healthy',     // Check MediaRecorder API
      pwa: 'healthy'        // Check service worker
    },
    uptime: Math.floor(process.uptime())
  });
}
```

### **Priority 2: Enhanced CI/CD Health Gates**

```yaml
# IMPLEMENT: Post-deployment health verification
post-deployment-health:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
  steps:
    - name: Comprehensive Health Check
      run: |
        # Wait for deployment stabilization
        sleep 30
        
        # Validate all services
        curl -f ${{ vars.API_URL }}/api/v1/health
        curl -f ${{ vars.FRONTEND_URL }}/api/health  
        curl -f ${{ vars.STUDENT_URL }}/api/health
        
        # Run comprehensive health audit
        npm run health:audit:production
```

### **Priority 3: Infrastructure Documentation**

```yaml
# DOCUMENT: AWS Load Balancer Configuration
# File: infrastructure/alb-health-checks.yml
LoadBalancer:
  HealthCheck:
    Path: /api/v1/health
    Protocol: HTTP
    Port: 3000
    HealthCheckIntervalSeconds: 30
    HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds: 5
    HealthyThresholdCount: 2
    UnhealthyThresholdCount: 3
```

### **Priority 4: Monitoring Integration Enhancement**

```typescript
// ENHANCE: Monitoring system integration
class HealthMetricsExporter {
  exportToCloudWatch() { /* AWS metrics */ }
  exportToDatadog() { /* Datadog integration */ }  
  exportToNewRelic() { /* New Relic integration */ }
}
