# 🏥 ClassWaves Platform Health Suite

## 📋 **Overview**

A comprehensive system to proactively find and resolve database schema issues, API problems, and platform inconsistencies before they cause production failures.

## 🛠️ **Tools Created**

### 1. **Comprehensive Health Audit** (`comprehensive-health-audit.js`)
**Purpose**: Deep, systematic audit of your entire platform
- ✅ Database schema validation (missing tables/columns)
- ✅ API endpoint health checks (detects 500 errors)
- ✅ Code vs schema consistency verification
- ✅ Migration status tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/comprehensive-health-audit.js
```

### 2. **Automated Monitoring** (`automated-monitoring.js`)  
**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring for continuous health checks
- ✅ Monitors for 500 errors in real-time
- ✅ Schema consistency validation
- ✅ Continuous monitoring mode (every 5 minutes)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Single check
node scripts/automated-monitoring.js

# Continuous monitoring
node scripts/automated-monitoring.js --continuous
```

### 3. **Migration Tracker** (`migration-tracker.js`)
**Purpose**: Track which database migrations have been applied
- ✅ Creates migration tracking table
- ✅ Records successful/failed migrations
- ✅ Shows pending migrations
- ✅ Executes migration files with tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
# Setup tracking
node scripts/migration-tracker.js setup

# Check status
node scripts/migration-tracker.js status

# Run a migration
node scripts/migration-tracker.js run ./scripts/my-migration.sql
```

## 🚀 **Recommended Workflow**

### **Daily Development**
1. **Morning Health Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run health:audit
   ```

2. **Before Commits**:
   ```bash
   npm run health:quick
   ```

3. **After Schema Changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:status
   ```

### **Production Deployment**
1. **Pre-deployment Audit**:
   ```bash
   npm run health:full
   ```

2. **Post-deployment Verification**:
   ```bash
   npm run health:monitor
   ```

## ⚡ **Quick Setup**

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "health:audit": "node scripts/comprehensive-health-audit.js",
    "health:quick": "node scripts/automated-monitoring.js",
    "health:monitor": "node scripts/automated-monitoring.js --continuous",
    "health:full": "npm run health:audit && npm run migration:status",
    "migration:setup": "node scripts/migration-tracker.js setup",
    "migration:status": "node scripts/migration-tracker.js status",
    "migration:run": "node scripts/migration-tracker.js run"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **What This Prevents**

### **Issues Like You Just Had**:
- ❌ Missing database columns causing 500 errors
- ❌ Incomplete schema migrations
- ❌ API endpoints returning unexpected errors
- ❌ Code expecting columns that don't exist

### **Future Issues**:
- ❌ New features breaking due to schema mismatches
- ❌ Silent failures in production
- ❌ Debugging time wasted on preventable issues
- ❌ Customer-facing errors

## 📊 **Sample Output**

```bash
🔍 === DATABASE SCHEMA AUDIT ===

📋 Checking table: classwaves.analytics.session_metrics
   ✅ All expected columns present

�� Checking table: classwaves.ai_insights.tier1_analysis
   ❌ CRITICAL: Table classwaves.ai_insights.tier1_analysis does not exist

🌐 === API ENDPOINTS AUDIT ===

🔄 Testing: GET /api/v1/analytics/teacher
   ✅ Returns expected status: 401

🔄 Testing: GET /api/v1/analytics/session/test-session-id  
   ❌ CRITICAL: /api/v1/analytics/session/test-session-id returns 500 Internal Server Error

📋 === COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH AUDIT REPORT ===

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (2):
1. MISSING_TABLE: Table does not exist
   Table: classwaves.ai_insights.tier1_analysis
2. API_500_ERROR: Internal Server Error - likely database or code issue
   Endpoint: /api/v1/analytics/session/test-session-id

🔧 === RECOMMENDED FIXES ===

💡 CREATE TABLE: Run creation script for classwaves.ai_insights.tier1_analysis
💡 FIX API: Investigate database query issues in /api/v1/analytics/session/test-session-id
```

## 🔄 **Integration with CI/CD**

Add to your GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Platform Health Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  health-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Health Audit
        run: |
          cd classwaves-backend
          npm run health:audit
      - name: Migration Status  
        run: |
          cd classwaves-backend
          npm run migration:status
```

## 🏆 **Benefits**

1. **Proactive Problem Detection**: Find issues before they hit production
2. **Systematic Resolution**: Clear, actionable reports with fix recommendations  
3. **Historical Tracking**: Know what migrations have been applied when
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for new issues
5. **Developer Confidence**: Deploy knowing your platform is healthy

## 🆘 **Emergency Response**

If you see CRITICAL issues:
1. **Stop deployments** until fixed
2. **Check the detailed JSON report** for specific fixes needed
3. **Run the recommended fixes** from the audit report
4. **Re-run health audit** to verify fixes
5. **Resume normal operations**
